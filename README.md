# The Incremental Framework

This was designed by Braymen, based on the framework he had designed for his first game, Fableverse. It comes with a few things that makes building incremental games much easier and gets you right into the code faster. It also comes packed with Electron & Steamworks integrations, so you can package the game for Steam as well. The goal of this project was to be open-sourced so others can utilize this framework or learn from it to build their own.
